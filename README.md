# MyGarage v0.0.1

## Check out how the project looks now: [MyGarage v0.0.1 Screenshot](https://github.com/Nixwzy/MyGarage/blob/main/assets/screenshot11_05_24.png) (11-05-24 v0.0.1)
## Project Overview
MyGarage v0.0.1 is a fictional application created as part of a university exercise, inspired by the need for a practical vehicle storage solution. The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for storing and managing vehicle information using Python.

This application serves as a case study, utilizing only Python and its libraries, specifically PIL and Tkinter. The development of MyGarage will evolve as I learn more about these technologies and gain more programming experience.

## Project Goals
With MyGarage, I aim to enhance my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and improve my skills in building GUI applications.

As I progress through my studies and projects, I intend to expand MyGarage into a more comprehensive application that could serve as a practical tool for managing personal vehicle collections.

## Installation
To run MyGarage, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to install the required library PIL (Pillow).

### Installing Pillow (PIL)
You can install Pillow using pip:

```
pip install PIL
```
