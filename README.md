## Project Overview
MyGarage is a fictional application created as part of a university exercise, inspired by the need for a practical vehicle storage solution. The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for storing and managing vehicle information using Python.

This application serves as a case study, utilizing only Python and its libraries, specifically PIL and Tkinter. The development of MyGarage will evolve as I learn more about these technologies and gain more programming experience.

## Project Goals
With MyGarage, I aim to enhance my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and improve my skills in building GUI applications.

As I progress through my studies and projects, I intend to expand MyGarage into a more comprehensive application that could serve as a practical tool for managing personal vehicle collections.

## Installation
To run MyGarage, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to install the required libraries: PIL (Pillow) and Tkinter.

### Installing Pillow (PIL)
You can install Pillow using pip:

```
pip install Pillow
```

### Installing Tkinter
Tkinter comes pre-installed with most Python distributions. If you encounter any issues, you can install it via your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

## Acknowledgments
- This project is inspired by my coursework and personal interest in programming and software development.

## Future Implementations
- Development of a dark mode to enhance user experience in low-light environments.
- Addition of a language toggle feature to allow users to switch between Portuguese and English.
